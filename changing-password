<p>If the customer chooses to secure their on-prem Replicated admin console with a password they can reset that password (or switch the authentication type to LDAP/unsecured) by visiting https://<code>&lt;server&gt;</code>/password-reset.</p>
<p>If they are unable to remember the password (and hence unable to access the /password-reset page), they can also reset the password if they have sudo access to the machine.</p>
<p>To do this they need to use the following command: <code>sudo replicated reset password</code></p>
