<p>If the customer chooses to secure their on-prem Replicated admin console with a password they can reset that password (or switch the authentication type to LDAP/unsecured) by visiting https://<code>&lt;server&gt;</code>/create-password.</p>
<p>If they are unable to remember the password (and hence unable to access the /create-password page), they can also reset the password if they have sudo access to the machine.</p>
<p>To do this they need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the following command: <code>sudo replicated auth reset</code> to remove the password</li>
<li>Visit https://<code>&lt;server&gt;</code>/create-password to create a new password or connect LDAP.<br>
